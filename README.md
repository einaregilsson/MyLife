MyLife
======

MyLife is a single-user replacement for OhLife, http://ohlife.com, 
a personal journal website that shut down on October 19th. 2014.
MyLife will send you an email every day, asking you "How was your day?". 
You reply to that email, optionally attaching some images, and
your reply will be stored in your personal MyLife journal. If you were
an OhLife user you can easily import your existing OhLife entries if
you have downloaded them before OhLife shut down.

MyLife is meant to be hosted on Google App Engine, where the
free quota should be enough to run it so you never have to pay
for its hosting. 

**MyLife is provided AS-IS, you use it at your own risk. I take no 
responsibility for it if it somehow fails, messes up your entries
by parsing your emails incorrectly, loses data or anything like that.
The responsibility is yours to check that it is functioning correctly.**
